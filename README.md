# xoroshiro128

Clojure implementation of the xoroshiro128+ PRNG described at http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/

The algorithm has been shown to be fast and produce superior statistical results to many PRNGs shipped with languages, [including Java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/453479/how-good-is-java-util-random). The statistical results have been verified in both PractRand and TestU01 by the authors.

xoroshiro128+ is designed to be the successor to xorshift128+, currently used in the JavaScript engines of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Both xorshift128+ and xoroshiro128+ have a period of 2<sup>128</sup> but xoroshiro128+ is **benchmarked by the authors as 20% faster and with 20% fewer failures in BigCrush than its predecessor.**

## Usage

Everything is in `xoroshiro128.core`.

`(require '[xoroshiro128.core])`

### Simple

The simplest usage is to simply call `rand` to generate a random long.

This uses an atom to store the state of the prng, which is updated to the next value in sequence on each call to `rand`.

`rand` is automatically seeded by `java.util.Random`, passed through splitmix64, and so should Just Work.

This atom can be manually reset/seeded (e.g. during testing) by calling `seed-rand!` and passing it a long. Internally, as per the suggestion in the reference implementation, this long will be passed through a splitmix64 generator to generate the two 64 bit seeds needed for the xoroshiro128+ algorithm. `seed-rand!` also accepts two arguments, which should both be longs to pass directly to xoroshiro128+ (no splitmix64 involved).

### Advanced

Both xoroshiro128+ and splitmix64 are implemented as immutable types with a shared protocol. The `IPRNG` protocol exposes `next` and `value` to generate the next item in the sequence or the long representing the current item, respectively.

This protocol allows us to construct a lazy sequence from a seed quite easily with `iterate` and `map`.

```clojure
(require '[xoroshiro128.core :as x])
(def seed 12345)
(def my-rand-seq (map x/value (iterate x/next (x/xoroshiro128+ seed))))
(take 5 my-rand-seq)
; (5983371452340661002 -139170902943549277 2600980751997770790 3131701164191746090 -3375623441569470803)
````

Additionally, we can inspect any item in the sequence to extract the seed, allowing us to resume the sequence from that point later.

```clojure
(require '[xoroshiro128.core :as x])
(def seed 9876)
(def my-rand-item (-> (x/xoroshiro128+ seed) x/next x/next x/next))

; Peek ahead at my-rand-item + 1
(x/value (x/next my-rand-item))
; 3486300715335445982

; Extract the seed from my-rand-item for later.
(.-a my-rand-item)
; -5785456751514194665
(.-b my-rand-item)
; 7961309068892779353

; Create a new item from our extracted seed.
(def new-rand-item (x/xoroshiro128+ -5785456751514194665 7961309068892779353))
; If we seeded correctly, new-rand-item + 1 should be the same as my-rand-item + 1.
(x/value (x/next new-rand-item))
; 3486300715335445982
````

The seeds for a xoroshiro128+ is `a` and `b`. The seed for a splitmix64 is `a`.

## Jump function

The Xoroshiro128+ algorithm supports a jump function to easily create new non-overlapping sequences from any starting point.

Calling the `jump` function is equivalent to calling `next` 2<sup>64</sup> times.

As the total period of Xoroshiro128+ is 2<sup>128</sup> it is possible to call jump 2<sup>64</sup> times before needing to reseed a totally new sequence.

If you are using simple calls to `rand` there is a `jump-rand!` function provided to jump the state of `rand`.

```clojure
(require '[xoroshiro128.core :as x])
(def seed 55555)
(def my-rand (x/xoroshiro128+ seed))
; jumped-rand is equivalent to 2^64 calls to (x/next my-rand)
(def jumped-rand (x/jump my-rand))
````

## Correctness

The outputs of Splitmix64 next value, Xoroshiro128+ next value, and the Xoroshiro128+ jump function have all been verified against samples from the reference C implementation.

Dozens of values were generated from https://ideone.com/PuauK5 and fed directly into the expected outputs for the test suite.

## Performance

I did some basic benchmarking on my laptop using [criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium) and found ~60% speed improvement using xoroshiro128+ vs. the default Java PRNG.

As always with benchmarking, YMMV.

I compared `(.nextLong (java.util.Random.))` against `(xoroshiro128.core/rand)`.
